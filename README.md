## Political Preparedness

PolitcalPreparedness is an example application built to demonstrate core Android Development skills as presented in the Udacity Android Developers Kotlin curriculum. 

This app demonstrates the following views and techniques:

MVVM + ViewModel + LiveData + Data Binding + Room Database + Koin (dependency injection)

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make api calls to an HTTP web service.
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) which handles the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects. 
* [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) to load and cache images by URL.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for local database storage.
* [Constraint Layout & Motion Layout]
* [Koin - A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin]
 
It leverages the following components from the Jetpack library:

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) with binding adapters
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments
